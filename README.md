### Project: Artificial Intelligence (DLBDSEAIS02)
Utilizing TensorFlow as the primary framework, the project focuses on emotion detection from facial expressions using a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN). TensorFlow's deployment capabilities, including TensorFlow Serving and TensorFlow Lite, ensure seamless transition to production. The workflow involves a pre-processing pipeline, transforming images to a 48x48 dimension from the mma-facial-expression dataset. The CNN architecture comprises convolution layers, max pooling, ReLU activation, dense layers, and a fully connected layer with Softmax activation. Model testing involves metrics like accuracy, recall, and precision, with the F1-score for multi-classification. Deployment is done via FastAPI and Docker, enabling local or cloud-based execution.

## Purpose
Build an AI tool for the marketing department to analyze emotional responses to company ads using facial expressions in images. Develop a system to categorize emotions (e.g., joy, anger, fear) from an image dataset. Choose relevant technologies for components and communication. The goal is to identify at least three emotional states through facial expressions.
